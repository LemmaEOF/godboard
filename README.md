# Godboard

*a hypothetical custom keyboard for Projekt GODHAND*

I mostly made this as practice for designing circuit boards; I don't really expect this to actually be
a feasible controller for the game (since it's not even out yet oops)

Upper left four keys are ASDF, upper right four keys are JKL;, each set of lower four are arrow keys, and
the button in the very center is Escape. Key lighting is intended to be blue on the left side and red on
the right side to match with Godhand's UI, with the Escape key set to green.

It's designed to have reverse-mount RGBLEDs on the south side of each key (probably SK6812MINI-E), and a
Pro Micro-compatible of your choice on a socket in the center.

I assume no liability for any damage this controller undertakes while being used for Projekt GODHAND.
